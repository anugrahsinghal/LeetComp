Not having any other offer as of now to negotiate. My current org has been giving 40%+ hike every year and I expect the same in March 2024 as well.

I am also planning to start preparing for GMAT asap and I\\'d need some study time every single day in order to prepare well. And 2 hours of classes MWF late at night.
