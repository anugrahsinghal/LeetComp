Recruiter mentioned that considering only your fixed compensation(8 lakh), the max they can offer is 10 lakh as base. My say is if the current compensation is already low then any hike looks great only in percentages and not absolute numbers. Also, HR directly said since company isn\\'t listed so they won\\'t consider ESOPs as per part of compensation to include it in the hike :( Please guide me how to proceed because I know this is way less than the market standard and what Paytm pays.
