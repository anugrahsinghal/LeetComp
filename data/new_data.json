Once you join as a Full-Time-Employee you will go through their Leap Program for 3 months, training you in Full Stack Technologies. After which you join your Business Unit and the squad as an Executive Graduate Trainee (EGT) then after a few more months when the probation is over you become a normal Associate Software Engineer. From the time you joined as an FTE, 1 year later you are promoted to a Software Engineer (Grade 3 to Grade 4) where your % increase is fixed for all new hires, and not dependent on your performance.\\n\\nFidelity provides yearly hikes which range from 5-20%, based on performance and you will be given a rating out of 3 ratings, where SP means Successful Performance and EP Exceptional Performance. I will have seen most people getting an SP with a 10-12% increase. Only 5% of people in your broader squad will get an EP with more than a 15% yearly hike.\\n\\nFidelity has kept their pay the same for the past 4 years, from the 2019-2023 batch, 12 LPA with a 10 BASE, which is not all at par with other financial firms.

Once you join as a Full-Time-Employee you will go through their Leap Program for 3 months, training you in Full Stack Technologies. After which you join your Business Unit and the squad as an Executive Graduate Trainee (EGT) then after a few more months when the probation is over you become a normal Associate Software Engineer. From the time you joined as an FTE, 1 year later you are promoted to a Software Engineer (Grade 3 to Grade 4) where your % increase is fixed for all new hires, and not dependent on your performance.\\n\\nFidelity provides yearly hikes which range from 5-20%, based on performance and you will be given a rating out of 3 ratings, where SP means Successful Performance and EP Exceptional Performance. I will have seen most people getting an SP with a 10-12% increase. Only 5% of people in your broader squad will get an EP with more than a 15% yearly hike.\\n\\nFidelity has kept their pay the same for the past 4 years, from the 2019-2023 batch, 12 LPA with a 10 BASE, which is not all at par with other financial firms. They give you a default promotion in 1st year of service even if you work crazy hard and a default yearly hike. People don\\'t get promoted from Software Engineer to Lead Software Engineer even after 4 years sometimes and the hike is also not at par. \\n\\nOverall Fidelity is a very good employee friendly company to work in, but the pay and career progression is not good at all.
