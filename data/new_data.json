However, I was still offered just 60k$ worth of stocks by Microsoft. Moreover, they always give around 50% of the varialble pay if you meet expectations. I was not provided with any relocation bonus also. \\nI had a long discussion with the recruiter but she was not ready to listen. I have seen L61 offers with a higher stock comonent than this. Its upsetting to see L62 offers having stocks as high as 120k-130k USD but only 60k$ USD for me, which is less than a few L61 offers as well. \\nI am currently awaiting another offer right now, and am quite certain that they would come up with good numbers. In this case, should I tell the new offer to the Microsoft recruiter to renegotiate after having accepted the offer?\\nNOTE - I am ready to walk away from the Microsoft offer in the worst case. I already have a good brand name on my resume, so even though Microsoft would be a good to have, its not my first priority. \\nThanks.", "company": "Microsoft", "role": "Sde2, L62", "yoe": "4.5", "salary": "40lpa", "salaryTotal": ": 59lpa For First Year, 56lpa From Subsequent Years.
