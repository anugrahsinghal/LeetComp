Haven\\'t solved much in atcoder.\\nPreparation strategy: \\nAlgorithms : \\n    Used to solve leetcode regularly in year starting and gave contests to keep my coding skills sharp. When my interviews got scheduled I just went through some standard medium/Hard problems. For most of the companies doing leetcode is enough. But please do questions in depth rathar than doing it for increasing the count of questions. Please give contests on LC. Always try to attempt harder questions than your current level. \\nSystem design : \\n     For LLD I have gone through online blogs and youTube but mainly I frame my answers according to my learnings till now. Ideally at 2+ years exp you are already aware of most of the basics of LLD so go through the basics of LLD and then apply your day to day Dev skills to frame the answer (please refer some standard questions online and then frame the answer that way). \\n\\t For HLD you can follow CodeKarle youTube channel, that covers all the basics of hld and he has covered all the standard questions. You can watch those and form your solutions according to that because any question can be answered using basics of hld and standard questions that are already available on youtube.\\n\\nOne more important note please give some mock interviews for algorithms and system design both and do not take hr round very lightly, please prepare for behavioural questions seriously before your hr/hm round. \\n\\nHow Did I apply : I applied thourgh referral, one of college seniors referred me in August end.\\nOther companies that I interviewed with : Zepto and got a call from Goldman for associate but my joining date was already very near by that time. Got ghosted by Zepto after two rounds. \\n\\nAccepted the offer as I am getting very good hike according to my current TC(and good tag on resume) and didn\\'t get to interview with any other company which can beat this TC. My only concern is if sf has good work or not (have read some online reviews that work is not that good here).
