I did try to negotiate with the HR but she didn\\'t budge. Also, by this november I would\\'ve gotten my annual hike and my base would have gone upto 17.5 or 18 but she wasn\\'t considering it, plus I did not have any other offer to negotiate with aswell.\\nI have accepted the offer, although it\\'s a lowball for L61 but I believe getting an SDE-2 role at 2.2 years of experience is a good jump. \\n\\n* What are your thoughts?\\n* Also, can anyone share the avg. annual hike an L61 gets at microsoft along with annual RSU reward(Refreshers)? I\\'m not confident on the numbers I know.\\n\\n**Interview Experience:** https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/5864184/Microsoft-or-L61-or-Hyderabad", "company": "Microsoft", "role": "L61", "yoe": "2.2 Years", "salary": "25l", "salaryTotal": ": 36.45l", "city": "hyderabad", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 2.2, "cleanSalary": 2500000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": 3645000, "cleanCompany": "Microsoft"}, {"id": "5863754", "title": "Zepto SDE 3 | Bangalore", "voteCount": 13, "viewCount": 1873, "date": "2024-10-03", "content": "College: Tier 1\\nEducation: BTech( CSE )\\nYears of Experience: ~7.5\\ncurrent comp - **~60L (50 base + 5 bonus + 5 RSU)**\\ncurrent company - Startup (recently went public)\\nCompany: Zepto\\nTitle/Level: SDE-3\\nLocation: 5 days WFO (Banglore, India)\\nBase Salary: **65L** (including PF)\\nSigning Bonus: 5L for 1 year\\nRetention Bonus: 3L for 1 year\\nPerf bonus : nil\\nRSU/ESOP: 60L for 4 yr equally distributed (paper money)\\nTotal comp 1st year (Base + Bonus + Stock): **~85L  [considering it 65L only because ESOPs are paper money]**\\n\\nVerdict: Declined offer because of uncertain future scope of zepto and bad wlb", "company": "Zepto", "role": "Sde-3", "yoe": "~7.5", "salary": "65l (including Pf)", "salaryTotal": "1st Year (base + Bonus + Stock): ~85l [considering It 65l Only Because Esops Are Paper Money]", "city": "bangalore", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 7.5, "cleanSalary": 6500000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": 8500000, "cleanCompany": "Zepto"}]
