Objects Round (60 Minutes):\\n\\nFirst part of my IBM interview was about coding and stuff. They gave me two coding questions to solve. Not too hard, just basic DSA stuff. They told me I had 60 minutes to finish them. It was a bit of a race against the clock, but I did my best.\\n\\n2. Tech Questions Round:\\n\\nNext, they started throwing tech questions at me. They really wanted to know how much I knew about tech stuff. It was kinda tough, but I tried my best to answer. They also gave me another coding challenge. This one was trickier than the first one. This round took like 45 minutes to an hour.\\n\\n3. HR Round (Chat About Job and Offer): \\n\\nAfter all that, we had a chat about the job they wanted to offer me. IBM\\'s HR team talked money, benefits, and all those job things. I asked a bunch of questions about the job just to make sure I got it. Then I said, \"Yeah, I want the job!\"\\n\\n\\n# NOTE\\n\\n- Mention  one project in your resume otherwise you will get rejected in this round even without an interview.\\n- Familiarise yourself with the core subjects.\\n- Try some coding contests for practice.\\n- Don\\'t feel bad if coding isn\\'t easy for you.\\n- If you\\'re stuck for a long time, don\\'t be shy.\\n- Don\\u2019t make a pre-mindset. \\n- Keep Cool. \\n\\n\\n", "company": "Ibm", "role": "Software Engineer Full Stack Developer", "yoe": "None", "salary": "150,000 Per Month", "salaryTotal": "", "city": "bangalore", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 0.0, "cleanSalary": 150000, "yrOrPm": "monthly", "cleanSalaryTotal": -1, "cleanCompany": "Ibm"}, {"id": "4060167", "title": "Cisco Systems | Software Engineer | Bangalore", "voteCount": 0, "viewCount": 515, "date": "2023-09-18", "content": "Education: B Tech in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering\\nYears of Experience: <1\\nPrior Experience: Interned at Cisco\\nDate of the Offer: August 2023\\nCompany: Cisco\\nTitle/Level: Software Engineer\\nLocation: Bangalore, India\\nBase Salary: INR 14,50,000\\nSign on Bonus: INR 3,25,000 (1st year) + INR 3,25,000 (2nd year)\\nRelocation + Variable Bonus: ~ INR 2,50,000\\nStock bonus: 0\\nTotal CTC: ~ INR 24,70,000\\n", "company": "Cisco", "role": "Software Engineer", "yoe": "", "salary": "Inr 14,50,000", "salaryTotal": ": ~ Inr 24,70,000", "city": "bangalore", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": -1.0, "cleanSalary": 1450000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": 2470000, "cleanCompany": "Cisco"}, {"id": "4060061", "title": "Amazon | Fresher 2023 | on Campus", "voteCount": 18, "viewCount": 2116, "date": "2023-09-18", "content": "Education: B.Tech EE from NIT (top 10) 2023 Passout\\nYears of Experience:  10 months as an intern\\nDate of the Offer: 2023\\nCompany: Amazon\\nTitle/Level: SDE1 (L4)\\nBase Salary: INR 19,17,000\\nBonuses: INR 6,47,000 (1st year) + INR 5,18,000 (2nd year)\\nStock bonus: ~15,56,000 vesting over 4 years\\nTotal comp for 1st year (Salary + Bonus ): ~ INR 25,64,000\\n\\n6 months delay in joining date. \\nTo address the financial impact this decision has a one-time payment of ~ INR 3,58,570\\n\\nJoining date : January 2024", "company": "Amazon", "role": "Sde1 (l4)", "yoe": "10 Months As An Intern", "salary": "Inr 19,17,000", "salaryTotal": ": ~ Inr 25,64,000", "city": "", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 0.0, "cleanSalary": 1917000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": 2564000, "cleanCompany": "Amazon"}]
