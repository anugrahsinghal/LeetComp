They really wanted to know how much I knew about tech stuff. It was kinda tough, but I tried my best to answer. They also gave me another coding challenge. This one was trickier than the first one. This round took like 45 minutes to an hour.\\n\\n3. HR Round (Chat About Job and Offer): \\n\\nAfter all that, we had a chat about the job they wanted to offer me.
