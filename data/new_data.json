Also they mentioned my level as Manager(Sr. Software Engineer B3) as they have to match the bands internally but I like to be on IC roles.\\n\\nNot sure what\\'s happening in the market. Shocked to see cogni paying such high amount. \\nFor me to decide the offer, I want to go outside India(UK/Europe) for around 5 years and may get that chance in Cogni as I had some discussion with Project Managers. But again not sure what will happen after joining.\\n\\nIn JPMC, I can definately apply for IJP after a year but chances are not sure in that too. I am inclining to JPMC because of YOY hikes and bonus. For this band i think cogni will hike mostly 1% - 5%(too optimistic). But in JPMC, I think hike of 10% is kind of average and bonus is also around 10% - 12%.\\n\\nI know this have to be my decision but I need help in some inputs at this stage. I want to work with a stable org with stable income. I have worked with startups as well but not want to join at this stage.\\n\\nPosted JPMC offer previously not sure why it is still not appearing in the discussion.", "company": "Cognizant", "role": "Manager(sr.
