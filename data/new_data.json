I literally did nothing other than working during the office time then doing leetcode and system design on whatever time I got left with including weekends. Then I actually got laid off and immediately started interviewing. I made to few onsites but got no offer other than this one so I accepted it. This entire year has been stressful for me, I feel the competition is high in the market right now for decent base salary. Anyways, remain motivated and keep working hard! \\n\\n\\n\\nPlease upvote if this helps you :)", "company": "Flexport", "role": "Sde-2", "yoe": "4", "salary": "55,00,000", "salaryTotal": "1st Year (base + Bonus + Stock): 65l + Rsusw", "city": "bangalore", "country": "india", "cleanYoe": 4.0, "cleanSalary": 5500000, "yrOrPm": "yearly", "cleanSalaryTotal": 6500000, "cleanCompany": "Flexport"}]
